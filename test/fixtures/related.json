            "An electronic digital machine designated for automating the processes of storage, search and logical processing of large volumes of information is discussed. Such a machine has extremely capacious intrinsic and extrinsic memory devices. Information machine installations basically per form logic operations (approximately 90%) and a small number of arithmetical ones (about 10%). It is used for processing statistical information concerning the national economy, search and logical processing of scientific and technical information, treatment of medical observations for refining and generalizing symptoms of an illness and methods for curing, for processing observations of natural phenomena (meterorological, seismic, cosmic, etc.)."

            "In this paper, we propose a new discriminative model named \\emph{nonextensive information theoretical machine (NITM)} based on nonextensive generalization of Shannon information theory. In NITM, weight parameters are treated as random variables. Tsallis divergence is used to regularize the distribution of weight parameters and maximum unnormalized Tsallis entropy distribution is used to evaluate fitting effect. On the one hand, it is showed that some well-known margin-based loss functions such as $\\ell_{0/1}$ loss, hinge loss, squared hinge loss and exponential loss can be unified by unnormalized Tsallis entropy. On the other hand, Gaussian prior regularization is generalized to Student-t prior regularization with similar computational complexity. The model can be solved efficiently by gradient-based convex optimization and its performance is illustrated on standard datasets."
